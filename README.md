## Example KubeJS Addon
### **1.20.4 NeoForge**

Basically just a quick mod template for KubeJS Addon Mods. I got annoyed setting up new mods for Kube so often, so thats why I made it. Yeah, I'll add more versions later.
If you're looking to learn how to make a KubeJS Addon, well you're not *really* in the right place, but I'll help you with the basics.

* Uses Arch Loom - 1.5 üßµÔ∏è
* NeoForge 20.4.223 
* KubeJS Version - 7.0-build.16 üü£
* Rhino Version - 2.3-build.4 ü¶èÔ∏è
* Architectury - 11.1.17 üèóÔ∏è

### Basic how-to

**1. Download the Mod**             
* You can use this repo's Template feature to make a new repo for yourself,
or you can clone it using your terminal:    
`git clone --branch minecraftversion-modloader https://github.com/FooterMan15/ExampleKubeJSAddon`   
`minecraftversion` being 1.20.4, 1.20.1, etc, plus modloader.

Alternatively if you use an IDE that supports generating projects from templates, you can clone it that way.

After cloning, you can remove the `.git` directory from the mod to initialize your own Github repository.

**2. Open with your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**          
* For IntelliJ IDEA, open the cloned mod folder, and run gradle task `ideaSyncTask` to generate run configurations for IDEA. Alternatively you can run gradle task `runClient` to start the game. 
**Note**: This may not work currently with Loom 1.5!
* For VSCode, you have to open the cloned mod folder, and run gradle task `vscode` to generate launch tasks for VSCode. Alternatively you can run gradle task `runClient` to start the game.      
* For Eclipse... ehh not really sure, but there is a gradle task for eclipse, called `eclipse`. I have no further info.

### For newbies
I assume you have come across my repo to make a quick addon mod for Kube. Here's how KubeJS integration is set-up:      
In this mod, there is a class here: [ExampleKubeJSPlugin](https://github.com/FooterMan15/ExampleKubeJSAddon/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/exampleaddon/kubejs/ExampleKubeJSPlugin.java)                             
This is the Plugin class. There you will apply your KubeJS integrations. I won't tell you how to create your integrations, read KubeJS's [README](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS/blob/2002/README.md#creating-a-plugin).             
You have to register your Plugin to Kube, otherwise nothing will happen. To do this, get your Plugin Class's full path (For example, `com.example.exampleaddon.kubejs.ExampleKubeJSPlugin`), and add it to the [kubejs.plugins.txt](https://github.com/FooterMan15/ExampleKubeJSAddon/blob/master/src/main/resources/kubejs.plugins.txt) file.

Alright, now go play with KubeJS.
